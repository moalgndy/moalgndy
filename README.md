- ⚡ Fun fact:In 2015, a team of programmers at Google developed an app called “Google Translate.” The app was designed to help people translate texts from one language to another. The app has been a huge success, having been used by more than 500 million people around the world. This application helped break down language barriers and made communication between people from different cultures much easier.
